Akhmal Rizkyanto, Currently Studying Computer Science. I like to share what i know and what i learn, so enjoy my little blog!

You can find the source code of my projects in:
[akhmal22 on Github][akhmal-github] &
[akhmal22 on Gitlab][akhmal-gitlab]

I will uploaded some materials at weekly basis, maybe one or two in a week in uncertain days of week, so stay tune. Also the language can swing between Indonesian or English for an uncertain occasion too.

Update May 29: Layout changes
