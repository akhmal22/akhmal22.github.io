# New Content Format
I decided to create new format of writing content, until now, there are 2 category of writing format, 'article' and 'misc'. I am going to make a category for paper breakdown writing, the content will be write down in 4 sections that can describe the paper well, the paper breaks into 'features', 'facts', 'findings' and 'future works'. Feature section describes what did the paper offers in term of research topic, objective and scope. Facts section describes the facts existed by the research documented on the paper goes on. Findings section describes all new things found through the research process. Future Works section describes possible research conduction following the current research's findings.

It seems more rigid than usual 'article' category format but I believe it is the efficient way to breakdown research papers, and obviously that format can change sometimes by the times fly. The paper breakdown seems to have more chance of more frequent content deliverability, so maybe the update will get longer in the future. (Akhmal R)
